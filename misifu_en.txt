The dogad has kidnapped Fred, and they will only free him if you destroy the rooms of a building. This building belongs to the bank that evicted 'dogad' friends. How do you do it? Just be a cat, misifu!!

Controls: OPQA SPACE  / Kempston (0 = pause)

- Alley. Try to jump inside a window, but be aware of the dog, he will try to bite you and take a live.
- Cheese. Try to eat ALL the mousies. Some holes are connected if you press space, just discover them
- Fishtank. Enter inside fishtank jumping inside it. Inside fishtank: eat all fishes but be aware of eels and oxygen.
- Bookself. Destroy the vases in the bookself, but be aware of the spider, and the dog!
- Bird. Throw the birdcage, eat the bird!
- Sleeping dogs. Press space when on drinkers, be aware of touching them three times, or you'll awake them... and that's not ending so well.
- Hearts. That's the last level and thus the most difficult. Reach the topmost without falling and you'll rescue Fred and see the ending.
Game will restart from Alley after hearts.

you won't be able to access next level until current one is completed, nevermind on which window was hit.
