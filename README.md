Misifu la gatita (WIP) - zxspectrum

Development in progress

# Building
radastan z88dktutorial is used here. 

You'll need z88dk, so you could download it from here:
http://nightly.z88dk.org/

Some utilities (MacOS version) have been included for easier compiling in utilszx. Original radastan tutorial contains the Windows version of such utilities (http://www.bytemaniacos.com/ficheros/zxspectrum/cursoz88dk.zip or http://foro.speccy.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3836).

Just execute (or makezx.bat from original radastan zip):
`$ ./makezx.sh` 


# To improve
*  redraw routines and transparencies.
*  use more colours (that could be fixed later, it's just replacing sprites)
* more pixel-perfect reproduction (I'm learning speccy!)
* use more z88dk functions (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/z88dk/z88dk/monosprites.md)

Contributions/suggestions are more than welcome!
