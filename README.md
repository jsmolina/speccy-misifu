Just execute :
`$ make` 

# Rebuilding sprites

See the Makefile as it contains udg and sprites lines.


# Story
```
La pérrada ha raptado a Fred, y sólo lo liberará si destrozas las habitaciones del edificio del propietario del banco que ha deshauciado a sus amigos. ¿Cómo lo harás? Como ya sabes, ¡a lo gatuno, misifu!
```

# Why it is not Fred again?
First, the original, GREAT AND ORIGINAL game Alley Cat is what it is, and I have to give it a respect. 
Second, nowadays my daughter asks me why most of the game heroes are 'males'.
Third, because `misifu` is a very affectionate way of calling a cat in Spain, my grandma did it so often.
